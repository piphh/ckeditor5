# The softBreak upcast conversion

This test is comparing how browser renders `<br>` elements in comparison to handling `<br>` conversion by the editor. Applied styles should make it easier to recognize boundaries between paragraphs. Parts with a dark blue background are headings that are separating test cases. Light blue background indicates paragraphs. Note that in the editor every content should get auto-paragraphed. At the beginning and end there are also a plain `<br>` elements to test the edge case.
